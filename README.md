Phylogenetic analyses of sex chromosome fusion
====

This repo contains the phylogenetic comparative analyses for our paper "Y fuse? Sex chromosome fusions in fishes and reptiles". This project is a collaboration between [Jun Kitano](http://www.nig.ac.jp/section/kitano/kitano-e.html), [Matthew Pennell](mwpennell.com), [Mark Kirkpatrick](http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/kirkpatrick_lab/k/home.html), [Sally Otto](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~otto/), [Jana Vamosi](http://people.ucalgary.ca/~jvamosi/), and [Katie Piechel](http://research.fhcrc.org/peichel/en.html). 

**Note**: Our paper contains both empirical and theoretical analyses; this repo is only for the emprical portion. See the supplementary material of the paper for Mathematica notebooks detailing all derivations.

This repo contains two folders:

### suppmat

The .tex files and figures to generate the supplementary materials

### analyses

All code to reproduce the analyses
